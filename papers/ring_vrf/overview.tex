\subsection{Ring VRF Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

As a beginning, we introduce a ring VRF interface, give a straightforward unamortised
 ring VRF protocol realising the desired security properties,
and give some intuition for our later amortization technique.
Similar to VRF \cite{vrf_micali}, a ring VRF construction needs: 

\begin{itemize}
\item $\rVRF.\KeyGen $ outputs secret and public keys $ (\sk, \pk)$.

\item $\rVRF.\Eval(\sk,\msg) \mapsto \Out$:  \emph{deterministically} computes the VRF output \Out from a secret key \sk and an input \msg.
\end{itemize}
%
% Although many constructions exist,
%Our \rVRF.\KeyGen and \rVRF.\Eval initially resemble EC VRFs like \cite{nsec5,VXEd25519,draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-10}.
% In other words,
% internally we prove a VUF output $\PreOut = \sk H_{\grE}(\msg)$,
% with a hash-to-curve $H_{\grE}$, so then applying a PRF $\Hout$ yields a
% VRF output $\Out = \Hout(\msg, h \PreOut)$ ala \cite[Prop. 1]{vrf_micali},
% using a key pair like $\pk = \sk \genG$ for a generator $\genG$.

%We demand pseudo-randomness properties from \Eval, which could mirror
%\cite{vrf_micali} if desired.  We provide a UC definition resembling
%\cite{praos,ucvrf} which handles adversarial keys better however. %NOT CLEAR WHAT HANDLING BETTER MEANS

We demand a pseudorandomness property from the output of \Eval for all $ \sk $.
%\eprint{In our construction in \S\ref{sec:pederson_vrf},  \rVRF.\KeyGen and \rVRF.\Eval resemble EC VRF like \cite{nsec5,VXEd25519,draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-10}.}{}

% As an instructive but insecure over simplification, 
In contrast to VRF, a ring VRF scheme has the following algorithms operating directly upon
 set of public keys \ring:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rVRF.\rSign(\sk,\ring,\msg, \aux) \mapsto \sigma:$
    returns a ring VRF signature $\sigma$ which is a proof for the ring VRF output of $ \msg $ as well as a signature signing $ \aux $.
\item $\rVRF.\rVerify(\ring,\msg,\aux,\sigma) \mapsto \Out \, \lor \perp:$
    returns either an output $\Out$ or else failure $\perp$. It returns $ \Out $ if $ \sigma  $ signs $ \aux $ with one of the keys in $ \ring $ and $ \Out $ is the ring VRF output of $ \msg $ and the same key that signs $ \aux $.
\end{itemize}


Ring VRF protocols deviate from VRF protocols in that they do not need the public key of the signer during the verification process. Instead, they use a set of public keys including the signer's key, like ring signatures. However, ring VRF protocols distinguish themselves from ring signatures   in the verification process as well  in which the unique ring VRF output of the signer is revealed if the signature is successfully verified with $\ring$.
In essence, a verified ring VRF signature of an input  $ \msg $ actually proves that $ \Out $ is the evaluation output of $ \msg $ generated by the signer's key. 

We want to achieve anonymity in ring VRF protocols meaning that the verifier learns nothing about the signer except that the  evaluation value of the signed input $ \msg $ is $ \Out $ and the signer's public key is in $ \ring $.
An intuitive ring VRF protocol could be instantiated by making
\rVRF.\Eval a pseudorandom function, and using a NIZK protocol $ \NIZK $ where $ \rVRF.\Sign $ runs the proving algorithm and $ \rVRF.\Verify $ runs the verification algorithm of $ \NIZK $ for a relation consisting of statement and witness pairs as follows:
%\vspace{-2mm}
\doublecolumn{
	\begin{scriptsize}
		$$ \rel_{\mathsf{rvrf}} = \Setst{ (\Out, \msg, \ring);(\sk,\pk)}{
		\begin{aligned}
			& (\pk,\sk) \leftarrow \rVRF.\KeyGen,\\
			& \pk \in \ring \\
			& \Out = \rVRF.\Eval(\sk,\msg) 
		\end{aligned}
		} $$
	\end{scriptsize}
}{
	$$ \rel_{\mathsf{rvrf}} = \Setst{ (\Out, \msg, \ring);(\sk,\pk)}{
	\begin{aligned}
		& (\pk,\sk) \leftarrow \rVRF.\KeyGen,\\
		& \pk \in \ring \\
		& \Out = \rVRF.\Eval(\sk,\msg)
	\end{aligned}
} $$
}



% TODO:  \PRF vs \rVRF.\Eval here??
% Although convenient for security arguments, % formalization


The zero-knowledge property of the NIZK ensures that our verifier learns nothing about the specific
signer, except that their key is in the ring and maps $\msg$ to $\Out$.
Importantly, pseudorandomness also says that \Out is an anonymous identity
for the specific signer, but only within the context of \msg. We ignore $ \aux $ in $ \rel_{\mathsf{rvrf}} $ for now just for the sake of simplicity. Otherwise, we note that it is imperative to incorporate \rVRF.\Sign and \rVRF.\Verify to sign associated data \aux. 


%In addition to the primary task of proving an evaluation value anonymously, it is imperative to incorporate \rVRF.\Sign and \rVRF.\Verify to sign associated data \aux. Neglecting this  would leave ring VRF signatures vulnerable, rendering them susceptible to replay attacks, particularly in identity applications. \eprint{As an example, our identity protocol below in \S\eprint{\ref{sec:app_identity}}
%	yields the same ring VRF outputs each time the same user logs into the
%	same site, which suffers replay attacks unless \aux binds the
%	ring VRF signature to the TLS session.}{}
% \smallskip

If one used the ring VRF interface described above, then one needs time
$O(|\ring|)$ in \rVRF.\rSign and \rVRF.\rVerify merely to read their \ring
argument, which severely limits applications.
Instead, we replace $ \ring $ with a commitment to the ring such as Merkle tree root and run asymptotically faster. Therefore, we introduce the following algorithms for $ \rVRF $.
\begin{itemize}
% \item $\rVRF.\CheckRing : \ring \mapsto \comring$ takes a set \ring of public keys and returns a public key set commitment \comring.
\item $\rVRF.\CommitRing : (\ring,\pk) \mapsto (\comring,\openring)$ \,
    returns a commitment for a set \ring of public keys, and
     the opening \openring if $\pk \in \ring$ as well.
\item $\rVRF.\OpenRing : (\comring,\openring) \mapsto \pk \, \lor \perp$ \,
    returns a public key \pk, provided \openring correctly opens
    the ring commitment \comring, or failure $\perp$ otherwise.
\end{itemize}

Together with these algorithms, we can replace the membership condition $\pk \in \ring$ in $  \rel_{\mathsf{rvrf}} $ by the opening condition
$ \pk = \rVRF.\OpenRing(\comring,\openring) $ and replace $ \ring $ in the statement with $ \comring $ and add $ \openring $ to the witness.
%
%\eprint{Indeed, regular (non-anonymous) VRF uses always encounter similar tension
%	with VRF inputs \msg being smaller than full message bodies $(\msg,\aux)$.
%	As an example, Praos \cite{praos} binds their VRF public key together
%	with a second public key for another (forward secure) signature scheme,
%	with which they sign their \aux, the block itself.
%	%
%	An EC VRF should expose an \aux parameter which it hashes when computing
%	its challenge hashes.  Aside from saving redundant signatures, exposing
%	\aux avoids user key handling mistakes that create replay attacks.}{}
%
%\eprint{Ring VRFs cannot so easily be combined with other signatures, which
%	makes \aux essential,%
%	\eprint{\footnote{If ring VRFs authorized creating blocks in an anonymous Praos blockchain then \aux must include the block being created, or else others could steal their block production turn.}}{}
%	but thankfully our ring VRF construction in \S\ref{sec:pederson_vrf} exposes \aux exactly like EC VRFs should do.%

%\eprint{Addressing these concerns, our notion should really be named 
% \emph{ring verifiable random function with additional data}
%and its basic methods look like
%\begin{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Our Approach.} Although an asymptotic improvement with $ \rVRF.\CommitRing $, 
the intuitive scheme can be computationally expensive to prove the evaluation value together with the membership condition. Therefore, in our first ring VRF protocol,  we divide the relation into two relations. The first relation $ \Reval $ is designed  to show the validity of the evaluation value with a proof that can be efficiently generated using discrete logarithm equality proofs. We integrate $ \aux $ in this proof so that the proof serves as a signature of $ \aux $ signed by the same key used to generate the ring VRF output.  The second relation $ \Rring $ is designed to show that the key used in the evaluation and signing $ \aux $ is in the ring. Its statement therefore has one part of the evaluation proof which is the Pedersen commitment to the secret key in order to relate the key in $ \Rring $ and $ \Reval $.

The most computationally expensive part of our first protocol is generating a proof for $ \Rring $ during signing. Therefore, we deploy a further optimization on this and design the second protocol. For this,  we consider optimising the cases where a party generates ring VRF signatures of different inputs for the \emph{same ring}. In this case, actually, the main change in the new signature is caused by the cheapest part of the signing process which generates proof for the ring VRF output and signature for $ \aux $  because the input changes so the evaluation value changes. Consequently, it raises the question of why a party should re-execute the ring membership proving.  In light of this, we deploy in the second protocol our  new notion ZK continuation that allows us to generate proofs for $ \rel_{\mathsf{rvrf}} $ by reusing a previously generated proof for ring membership with simple operations. 
In a nutshell, if a party once generates a ring VRF signature for $ \ring $ in our second scheme, this signature has a  Pedersen commitment to the secret key $ \sk $ i.e., $ \compk = \sk \genG + \openpk \genB $ as a part of the proof for the output similar to our first scheme. When this party generates another signature for a different input  with $ \ring $, they (re)randomize the  existing proof for the ring membership with a random number $ \openpk' $ rather than  running the proving algorithm for the ring membership from scratch. Then, they generate a new proof for the ring VRF output by running the proving algorithm for the ring VRF output by setting the new Pedersen commitment to the secret key with $ \compk' = \sk \genG + \openpk'\genB $ which is the new  Pedersen commitment to the secret key generated  with the same randomness $ b' $ used in ring membership.

%TODO: WE SHOULD EXPLAIN IT BETTER FOR EPRINT
%We discovered the SNARK for the language \Lring becomes incredibly efficient for the prover if one specializes
%the original Groth16 SNARK construction:  An inner original Groth16 SNARK for $\Lring^\inner$
%handles the secret key \sk directly via its public inputs, but
%\sk and even \pk remain secret by transforming the trusted setup to have
%a rerandomizable Pedersen commitment \compk outside this Groth16 SNARK.
%$$ \Lring^\inner = \Setst{ \sk, \comring}{
%    \eprint{
%    (\pk,\sk) \leftarrow \rVRF.\KeyGen, \, % \textrm{\,and }

%    }
%} $$
%
%Our zero-knowledge continuation in \S\ref{sec:rvrf_cont} rerandomizes
%$\compk = \pk + b \, K$ without reproving the Groth16 SNARK for $\Lring^\inner$.
%For this, the secret key \sk must be a public input of $\Lring^\inner$, and
%the Groth16 trusted setup must be expanded by a secret multiple of
% the otherwise independent point $K$.
%
%In \S\ref{sec:pederson_vrf}, we introduce an extremely efficient NIZK
%for $ \rel_{eval} $, which also provides an essential proof-of-knowledge for \compk.


\endinput


% We define ring VRFs in \S\ref{sec:rvrf_games} and \S\ref{sec:rvrf_uc_fun} below, but
Ring VRFs are firstly ring signatures broadly interpreted, in that they
prove an involved public key lies inside some commitment \comring to
the plausible signer set, known as the ring.
Anyone could compute \comring from this set of public keys.
%
At the same time, ring VRFs prove correct output of a PRF keyed by
the signer's actual secret key, and evaluated on a supplied message \msg,
which then links ring VRF signatures on the same \msg.
