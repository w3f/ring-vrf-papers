\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive, called a ring VRF, which combines the unique properties of VRFs  and ring signatures. Our new primitive is ripe for use in secret leader election and identity systems.  Ring VRFs may find applications in a wide range of other use cases, including rate limiting systems, rationing, and private voting, as in \cite{Semaphore}. We propose two distinct ring VRF constructions, one offering flexibility in instantiation and the other focusing on optimizing signature generation within the same ring. To this end, we introduce the notion of a ZK continuation, which enables the efficient regeneration of proofs by preserving the ZK property and is likely of independent interest.
